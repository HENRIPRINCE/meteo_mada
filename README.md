# meteo_mada
This application will process the local weather for the 22 regions of Madagascar.
I use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve information by the longitude and latitude coordinates of each chief town of the region.
1st processing for the weather at the time of launching the program
2nd treatment the metrological forecast for the next 5 days.
It's a merge between Google Maps and OpenWeatherMap.
